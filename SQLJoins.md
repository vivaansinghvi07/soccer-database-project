| Inner Join      | - An inner join displays values whose keys match in both tables  - Rows only get displayed if the key shows up in rows of both tables.                                                                                                               | - You can use this if you are only interested in the relation between two tables; if you donâ€™t care about individual values of either table, and only care about how two tables are linked; for example, only displaying products who have vendor information available, because you want to learn about the vendor info products at that store. | - Say table one has a primary key of cust_id, which relates to table 2 in the form of a foreign key. - If there were three rows in table one, where cust_id is 2, 3, and 4, and two rows in table two, where cust_id is 2, 5:- An inner join would only display the row which had the 2, as it is the only one in common to both tables. |
| Right/Left Join | - A sided join displays all the rows of one table and on the second table, only displays the rows which appear in table 1 (through the join key) - A left join gets all the values from the first mentioned table, and a right join does vice versa | - You can use this if you want all the entries from a table, regardless of whether the entries are present in the other table - select all of table A, and any relations it may have with table B.                                                                                                                                                | - Say for example you had a table of people, and you wanted to display all the people in that table. However, some of those people were employed, and their job description is in the jobs table. So, if you wanted to show all the values of people and their job (if they had one) you would left join people with jobs.              |
| Outer Join      | - An outer join simply returns all values from both tables, regardless of if they have matches with each other or not.                                                                                                                               | - You use this when you have two tables you want to examine, and only care about a join if it helps make data more convenient to read or access.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | - Say you had a table A and a table B, and wanted to see all rows for both tables, but the tables are able to be joined using a foreign key. - You would use an outer/full join to see what all the rows were, but rows that are in common with one another (i.e. share a key) would be displayed together.                             |
